# 🧠 Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker  

---

## 📝 Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced, digitally-driven world, people often Google symptoms and fall into the rabbit hole of misinformation, panic, or neglect. Not everyone has immediate access to a doctor, and not every symptom requires one either.

That’s where **Agentic AI** comes in — a **non-diagnostic, AI health agent** that interprets your symptoms using natural language and provides safe, educational, and preventive advice.

---

## 💡 What We Built

**Agentic AI Health Symptom Checker** is a virtual assistant designed to:

- 🧠 Interpret symptoms in plain English (and more languages!)
- 🚦 Estimate urgency levels
- 🌿 Suggest preventive tips and home remedies
- 🧑‍⚕️ Advise when it’s time to see a medical professional

⚠️ *It’s not a doctor — it’s a smart companion for awareness, not diagnosis.*
